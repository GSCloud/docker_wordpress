- available **temporary static web** (optional) containers during *suspend*, *backup* and *restore* operations (for users or monitoring services)
- available **wp** binary with **shell completion**, **bash aliases** and some *PHP ini setup*

## Usage

Run `make` to see the help.

## Examples

- `make purge install` - purge everything and fresh install
